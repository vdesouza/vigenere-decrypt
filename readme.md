# Vigenere Cipher Decrypt

A python script that, given a Vigenere cipher created with an unknown keyword of unknown length, will:

- create an Index of Coincidence analysis
- use analysis and English character frequencies to generate a best guess keyword
- use generated keyword to decrypt message.

Outputs `keyword.txt` with the best guessed keyword and `message.txt` with decrypted message.
